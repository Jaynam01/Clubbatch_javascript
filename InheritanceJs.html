<!-- The JavaScript inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already existing classes. It provides flexibility to the child class to reuse the methods and variables of a parent class.

The JavaScript extends keyword is used to create a child class on the basis of a parent class. It facilitates child class to acquire all the properties and behavior of its parent class. -->
