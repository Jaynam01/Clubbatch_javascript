        ------------------------------------


        -> arithmetic operators 

        + addition  
        - substraction
        * multiplication
        % modulus(remainder)
        / division
        ++ increment     
        -- decrement 

        -> comparison(realation) operators

        ==  is equal to
        === indentical (equal and of same typr)        
        !=  not equal to 
        !== not indentical
        >   greater than
        >=  greater than or equal to
        <=  less than or equal to 
        <   less than

        &   Bitwise AND	
        |   Bitwise OR
        ^   Bitwise XOR	
        ~   Bitwise NOT
        <<  Bitwise Left shift	
        >>  Bitwise right shift
        >>> Bitwise right shift with zero


        -> logical operators

            &&  Logical AND
            ||  Logical OR
            !   Logical NOT


        -> assignment operators  
        
            =   Assign
            +=  Add and Assign
            -=  Substract and Assign
            *=  Multiply and Assign
            /=  Divide and Assign
            %=  Modulus and Assign
